*"The possession of knowledge does not kill the sense of wonder and mystery. There is always more mystery."---Anais Nin*  


I am an art librarian living and working in Philadelphia. I work on the research and development of new initiatives, digital tools, and projects at the [Philadelphia Museum of Art](www.philamuseum.org). What does this mean? Well- at the moment, I am working on the launch of the Museum's first online scholarly publication and I administer an IMLS grant for [NDSR Art](http://ndsr-pma.arlisna.org/), a post-graduate residency program where new professionals address the challenges of preserving digital art and art information. 

I am passionate about furthering knowledge through access to and preservation of our cultural heritage. 
I am particularly interested in the use of digital scholarship to facilitate innovative research, illuminate connections, 
and create a more collaborative learning environment. 

Additionally, I enjoy traveling abroad, gardening, yoga, climbing, and taking pictures.
