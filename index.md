I am an art librarian living and working in Philadelphia. I work on the research and development of new initiatives, digital tools, and projects at the [Philadelphia Museum of Art](www.philamuseum.org). Currently, I am working on the launch of the Museum's first online scholarly publication and I administer an IMLS grant for [NDSR Art](http://ndsr-pma.arlisna.org/), a post-graduate residency program where new professionals address the challenges of sustaining access to digital art and art information. I am interested in the use of digital tools to facilitate innovative research, illuminate connections, and create collaborative learning environments. 

I enjoy traveling, gardening, yoga, rock climbing, and photography.
