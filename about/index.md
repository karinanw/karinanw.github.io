### About

As a librarian at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, I project manage and assist with the research and development of new initiatives, digital tools, and platforms for internal, cross-departmental, and external projects. I am working on the launch of a digital publication and I am the program manager for [NDSR Art](http://ndsr-pma.arlisna.org/). 

I am passionate about furthering knowledge through access to and preservation of our cultural heritage. 
I am particularly interested in the use of digital scholarship to facilitate innovative research, illuminate connections, 
and create a more collaborative learning environment.
