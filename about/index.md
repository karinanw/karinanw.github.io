### About

I am passionate about furthering knowledge through access to and preservation of our cultural heritage. 
I am particularly interested in the use of digital scholarship to facilitate innovative research, illuminate connections, 
and create a more collaborative learning environment. As a librarian at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, I project manage and 
assist with the research and development of new initiatives, digital tools, and platforms for internal, cross-departmental, 
and external projects. 

I am the program manager for NDSR Art, a post-graduate residency program where young professionals tackle the challenges 
of digital preservation of art information.
